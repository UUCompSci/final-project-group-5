// Need to create cell objects that are not the player's cell and give them a size and name.
// Need to create Clusters that contain many cells
// DO NOT need to create food objects because food is an enum of just "meat" and "plant"

// ===== RUNTIME =====

// Cells can be created through user input. ie. "Create Carnivore: 'Bobby'"
// Player's cell is size 3 by default.
// Cells encounter plant and meat food and can choose to eat it
// Cells can encounter other cells and eat them if carnivores
// Other Cell's size is then added to the Cell's size
// Agar.io
// Cells can encounter Clusters of other cells which they can join the cluster (Eventually that will add them to the cluster in the database)
// This acts like a "House"
